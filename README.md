This project implements a Simple Student Management System using Object-Oriented Software Design principles. The main purpose of the system is to capture student information such as Student ID, Name, Course, and Marks, and automatically calculate and display the student’s grade based on the marks entered. The system demonstrates the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, including Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

The system is composed of four main classes: Person, Student, Course, and StudentManagementSystem. The Person class is designed as an abstract class that contains the common attribute name and an abstract method displayDetails(). This demonstrates the concept of Abstraction because it provides a general template for derived classes without implementing full functionality. The Student class inherits from the Person class, demonstrating Inheritance. It contains private attributes such as studentId and marks, which are accessed through getter and setter methods to ensure Encapsulation and protect data from direct modification.

A separate Course class is included to store the course name. The Student class contains a Course object, demonstrating composition (a “has-a” relationship), where a student is associated with a specific course. The Student class also overrides the displayDetails() method from the Person class, demonstrating Polymorphism through method overriding. Additionally, the Student class contains a method for calculating grades based on the student’s marks using conditional logic.

The StudentManagementSystem class serves as the main application class and contains the program entry point (main method). It collects user input, creates objects for Course and Student, and displays the student information along with the calculated grade.

Overall, the system successfully demonstrates the application of object-oriented design principles in developing a simple but functional student management solution.
